What is D3?

# D3

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">Data driven visualizations</li>
	<li class="fragment">Open web standards</li>
	<li class="fragment">Familiar conventions</li>
</ul>

>> Speaker Notes:

D3 is a framework is a visualization library for building data-driven graphics.

It lets you build graphics that use common web standards, which makes the graphics easily accessible through any web browser. That means, you can use javascript to generate regular HTML and CSS visualizations, or the slightly and more flexible Scalable Vector Graphics (known as SVG).

D3 uses conventions that are familiar to most users, so learning the language should be pretty easy for web designers and developers who understand basic javascript.

# Selectors

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">CSS Selectors</li>
	<li class="fragment">Function chaining</li>
	<li class="fragment">CSS Styling</li>
</ul>

>> Speaker Notes:

It uses a CSS-like format for selecting elements. So if you already know how to work with CSS or jQuery, you already know how to make d3 sections.

If you have some experience working with jQuery, where the results of one function are fed to another, then D3 will be easy to pick up. A lot of what you do in d3 is issue an entire set of drawing instructions comes stringed together as a single command.

Once you create your graphics, you don't use some strange proprietary language to style things, you can style things through CSS, just as you would your regular page elements.

# Data & More

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">Easy parsing</li>
	<li class="fragment">Data-binding</li>
	<li class="fragment">Transitions &amp; Animations</li>
</ul>

>> Speaker Notes:

- D3 makes parsing...or the process of importing data from common formats easy. Building parsers can be programmatically challenging, but is baked right into d3 do that you don't have to worry about it.

You can easily bind data to functions to execute a function on a sequence of data. You use a simple method and provide that method a URL and then you can specify a callback that does something with the data.

D3 provides a rich language for building transitions and animations, which makes building interactive graphics simple.

Overall, you'll find that creating graphics with D3 will be easy once you learn the basics of the language...and that's what this course is about, so let's keep going.
